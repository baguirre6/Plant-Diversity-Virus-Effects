<h2>Associated Paper Abstract</h2>

1.	Plant diversity in wild and agricultural plant communities has been shown to protect plant communities from pathogens, and the effects of many aspects of diversity (species richness, evenness, and their combination) on virus epidemiology have been examined. Increasing species or genetic diversity of one species can influence the prevalence of a widespread and economically important generalist grass virus, barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV). However, virus prevalence may differ among distinct grass functional types (C3 vs. C4) due to differences between their temporal seasonal activity, palatability to aphid vectors, and plant physiology. Plant functional group (e.g., grasses, legumes, and non-leguminous forbs) diversity is known to reduce plant diseases in unmanaged and agricultural plant communities, yet their potential interactions and effects on plant virus disease prevalence has not been examined. 

2.	Here, we evaluated the effect of grass functional type (three C3 and three C4 species), along with plant functional group richness, and composition, on virus prevalence in experimental annual plant communities that were inoculated with aphids carrying BYDV-PAV. We also assessed the relationships between virus prevalence and the productivity of the total community (grasses + forbs+ legumes), as well as the component plant functional types.

3.	In these experiments, BYDV-PAV prevalence did not vary between C3 and C4 grasses and neither functional group richness nor functional group composition mitigated or amplified virus prevalence in grass hosts. However, we found a strong positive correlation between virus prevalence and C3 grass productivity (but not C4 productivity).

4.	Synthesis. Our findings indicate that virus prevalence in grasses was not diluted by increased plant functional group richness or altered plant functional group composition. However, we found that virus prevalence positively influenced C3 grass productivity. Together, these findings help us understand that while plant diversity did not reduce cryptic virus prevalence, mutualistic plant-virus interactions can contribute to enhanced ecosystem functioning via increased productivity.
